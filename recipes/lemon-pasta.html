    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This citrusy and filling pasta dish is pretty easy to cook</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Lemons</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water in a small pot and bring it to a boil. You don't need a lot of it. 2 
            cups should be enough.

            Meanwhile, oil (or butter) a saucepan and toss in the chopped garlic and lemon peels, 
            then cook over low heat for a few minutes until the garlic turns golden brown. After 
            that turn off the heat and wait for the water in the other pan to come to a boil. 
            Salt the water.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the lemon peels from the pan, add the spaghetti, turn the heat back on, and 
            pour over 2 ladles of the boiling water. Stir well with wooden chopsticks, trying 
            to keep the noodles from being in too much contact with any unwetted sides of the 
            pan.
        </li>
        <li>After a few minutes, the water will have been absorbed by the noodles and you will 
            begin to see the starch settle to the bottom of the pan, forming a kind of cream. 
            Add 2 more ladles of water and let it absorb. Keep doing so until the pasta is cooked.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat, give it one last stir with chopsticks, and scrape some 
            lemon peel over everything.

            If you chose to add Parmesan cheese, pour it over the pasta, cover everything with a 
            lid, and let it sit for 5 minutes. This will make the cheese blend with the starch 
            released from the pasta, giving it extra creaminess. Serve aside with some more grated 
            parmesan cheese.
        </li>
    </ol>
