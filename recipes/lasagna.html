    <ol>
        
        <li>Preheat oven to 170 degrees C. Lightly oil a baking dish or coat with nonstick 
            spray.
        </li>
        
        <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook lasagna noodles according to package 
            instructions.
        </li>
        
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add ground beef 
            and onion and cook until beef has browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble 
            the beef as it cooks; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Drain excess fat. Stir 
            in tomatoes and Italian seasoning until well combined.
        </li>
        
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella and egg; set aside.
        </li>
        
        <li>Spread 1 cup tomato mixture onto the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish; top with 3 
            lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup mozzarella cheese. 
            Repeat with a second layer. Top with remaining noodles, tomato mixture, 1 cup 
            mozzarella cheese and Parmesan.
        </li>

        <li>Place into oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until bubbling. Then broil for 
            2-3 minutes, or until top is browned in spots. Let cool 15 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>Serve, garnished with parsley, if desired.
        </li>
