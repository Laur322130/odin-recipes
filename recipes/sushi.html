    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Making sushi at home, while not very easy to make the first time, is still a great way 
        to enjoy the amazing taste of sushi without having to spend a lot of money
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Japanese Short Grain Rice</li>
        <li>Seasoned Rice Vinegar</li>
        <li>Cucumber</li>
        <li>Sushi Tuna</li>
        <li>Nori Sheets</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Wasabi(optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare sushi rice by mixing cooked short-grain rice with seasoned vinegar.
        </li>
        <li>Cut both ends of the cucumber and peel it. Now cut it in half lengthwise and repeat 
            to get 4 strips. Remove the seeds and cut again to get 8 pieces in total.
        </li>
        <li>Cut out thin slices of raw tuna, about ¼- ½ inches thick. Make long stripes.
        </li>
        <li>Place the bamboo mat on a flat surface and cover it with a plastic sheet. Now put the 
            Nori sheet on the bamboo mat. Remember that the rough side of the Nori should face 
            towards you.
        </li>
        <li>Moisten your hands. Take a medium ball of sushi rice in your hands and spread an even 
            layer on the Nori. Use your fingers to apply gentle pressure and keep a half-inch 
            space on all sides.
        </li>
        <li>Now add cucumber and tuna strips in the middle section of the rice. If the tuna or 
            cucumber pieces are short, you may add extra pieces lined up to cover the Nori 
            sheet's length.
        </li>
        <li>Roll the bamboo mat away from you to create a tight and compact log. Keep pressing 
            slightly as you roll to ensure that the ingredients stick together properly. Apply 
            a few drops of water on the edges and seal it.
        </li>
        <li>Moisten the knife and cut the roll into 6-8 pieces. Serve with soya sauce and wasabi. 
            Repeat the steps for the remaining ingredients.
        </li>
    </ol>
