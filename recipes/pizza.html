    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When you want something better than takeout that's still simple to make, a homemade pizza 
        is the answer
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Active Dry Yeast</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Warm Water</li>
        <li>All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Dried Oregano</li>
        <li>Dried Basil</li>
        <li>Mozzarella</li>
        <li>Any Toppings, for example: Pepperoni, Bacon, Champignons, Black Olives, Red Peppers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water. Let it stand for five 
            minutes to let the yeast foam up and activate. Add the oil and salt. Stir in the 
            flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms.
        </li>
        <li>Turn the dough onto a floured surface, and knead the dough until it's smooth and 
            elastic, two to three minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning once to 
            grease the top of the dough. Cover the bowl, and let the dough rise in a warm place 
            until doubled, about 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Punch down the dough, and divide it in half. Press 
            each half into a greased 12-inch pizza pan.
        </li>
        <li>In a bowl, stir together the tomato sauce, oregano and basil. Spread the sauce over 
            each crust. If desired, add toppings of your choice. Sprinkle with cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake until the crust is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
